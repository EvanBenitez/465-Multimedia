<h4>Major: Computer Science</h4>

<h4>Goals for this Course</h4>
<p>
As with many course I have taken, I don't have any particular goals for this class, other than to learn as 
much as I can. Also, as with many of the class I have taken, I'm not entirely sure of what I can expect to learn,
other than it involve multimedia (Images, videos, audio). I suppose I expect to learn how to use these with some 
degree of advanced proficeny in code.
</p>

<h4>Proficiencies</h4>
<p>
I have gain some degree of proficeny in html with my tenure here at csu. Asside from these homework assignments,
I've also done the Internet programing course, and am currently working on a senior design project that involves
the maintaince and adding additions to a website for IT in Northeast ohio. This is done in Angular, but HTML is 
a prerequisite. I've programed in Java, C, C# (with Unity), Python, Javascript and various other internet progrmaing
languages.
</p>

<p>I find that I <b>OFTEN</b> need to look up how to <i>use</i> the Greek Letters such as &Theta; or &Alpha;, but
sometimes I can get by by guessing at what the code is, as it is usually just the word. Mathmatical symbols such as
&plus; or &minus; can be a bit tricker, since some of the mathmatical noation names are not as obvious.
